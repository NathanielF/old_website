      <description>There is an aesthetic discipline to mathematics as much as there is an expectation of rigour. We shall attempt to showcase the relation between aesthetic dimension of a proof with its explanatory purchase. We shall take as our example a standard proof used in regression analysis to find the slope of a line/plane which maps the trajectory of a series of observed points/locations along a trajectory. Given this problem we can draw a line/plane with the slope and it can be shown that this line (as a function of slope) is the best available line that can be drawn through our points of observation.</description>
