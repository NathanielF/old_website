      <description>Despite sounding like the protagonist of rejected sci-fi script, the perceptron is just a lowly algorithm. Inspired by the model of neuronal triggering patterns, this simple linear classifier was designed to enact a pseudo-biological processing mechanism. As our brain receives and processes different inputs it unconsciously corrects for infelicities in rendering based on a weighting derived from past experience. The thought is that we are progressively conditioned for behaviour that expedites performance of perceptual and physical reflex.</description>

      <description>The ubiquity of matrix manipulation in machine learning means that languages like R and Python, which have been optimised for linear algebra, are very well suited to the task of making robots think. It is less clear to me whether Skynet could be written in Golang?
There are a number of machine learning packages in development but none have the naturalness of an R implementation. To that end I decided to create some of the functionality I need.</description>

      <title>Why is OLS BLUE?</title>

      <description>There is an aesthetic discipline to mathematics as much as there is an expectation of rigour. We shall attempt to showcase the relation between aesthetic dimension of a proof with its explanatory purchase. We shall take as our example a standard proof used in regression analysis to find the slope of a line/plane which maps the trajectory of a series of observed points/locations along a trajectory. Given this problem we can draw a line/plane with the slope and it can be shown that this line (as a function of slope) is the best available line that can be drawn through our points of observation.</description>
